There's now iRoboticsDS which is a refined version of BigPapaDS.  
If you want to use iRoboticsDS, there is example arduino code for recieving controller data from iRoboticsDS.
There's a pdf that include the packet structure for the controller data and feedback.  
It's fairly rugged and includes a failsafe and also has a smaller packet from using checksums.
